/**
 * This is my personal collection of solutions to Project Euler problems.  It is mostly a personal exercise in 
 * several fields, namely problem solving, refactoring and Test Driven Development (TDD).
 * 
 * 
 * Each solution is implemented as a JUnit test case extending BaseTestCase.  When I tackle a new problem, I implement
 * a new subclass of BaseTestCase and attempt to solve the problem.  Once my solution is accepted by the ProjectEuler
 * website, I implement the getAnswer() method with the known correct answer.   Then I attempt to refactor the problem
 * into a simple and easy to understand solution.
